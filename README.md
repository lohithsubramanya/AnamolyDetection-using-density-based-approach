# AnomalyDetection-using-density-based-approach
This analysis is done to check if we can predict the anomalies/outliers considering the underlying density distribution for continuous variables  
Anomalies detection is a very helpful technique and can be used to avoid many real time problems such as identifying whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not. This can be done by checking if the current transaction is somehow way too different from existing past transaction.
